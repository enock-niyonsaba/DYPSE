# Dynamic Youth Profiling System for Employment (DYPSE)

## Overview
The **Dynamic Youth Profiling System for Employment (DYPSE)** is a web and mobile application designed to tackle youth unemployment by creating a dynamic ecosystem that connects **job seekers, employed professionals, and entrepreneurs** with opportunities. The platform integrates **AI-powered analysis, Supabase for structured data, MongoDB for unstructured data (e.g., CV parsing, business docs), and LinkedIn Jobs integration** to create a one-stop hub for youth empowerment.

---

## Problem Statement
Youth unemployment remains a significant issue in Africa, with limited access to:
- Verified job opportunities
- Professional networks
- Entrepreneurial support
- Structured + unstructured career insights

Many systems lack integration of **real-time job updates, AI-powered skill-job matching, and validation for entrepreneurs**. DYPSE solves this gap.

---

## Core Objectives
- Provide a **youth-centered digital profile system**.
- Connect youth to **jobs, internships, and entrepreneurial opportunities**.
- Enable **AI-driven recommendations** for career growth.
- Foster **micro-business creation and networking** opportunities.
- Ensure **secure, scalable, and real-time integrations** with existing platforms like LinkedIn.
